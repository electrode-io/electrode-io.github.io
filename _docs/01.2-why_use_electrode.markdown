You know us as the world’s largest retailer, but we’re also one of the world’s fastest growing [e-commerce](www.walmartlabs.com) companies. [Electrode](www.github.com/electrode-io) is the platform that powers the Walmart.com customer experience. When you use [Walmart.com](www.walmart.com), you use Electrode — so you know it’s battle tested!

We solve complex problems on an unimaginably big scale and build [awesome modules](stand_alone_modules.html) that optimize performance and efficiency. [Electrode](what is electrode.html) enforces modern web development best practices throughout the development cycle, encouraging clean, modular, reusable components while remaining easy to develop and deploy on.

Electrode also supports isomorphic rendering/universal JavaScript, CSRF (Cross Site Request Forgery) protection, internationalization, component tooling, progressive web app standards, and everything developers need to successfully develop and deploy complex enterprise-scale React/Node.js applications.

We are continuing to improve Electrode—future enhancements will include more progressive web app features for mobile, bigger investments in performance, and much more. Learn about what inspires us and [read more about](stand_alone_modules.html) the framework we are building.
