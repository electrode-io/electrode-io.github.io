At Walmart Labs, we solve problems on a vast scale, serving millions of
customers every day via our web and mobile apps. So we designed Electrode to
handle large, complex React/Node.js applications, with advanced features
including server-side rendering, CSRF (Cross Site Request Forgery) detection,
internationalization, component tooling, and progressive web application
standards.

We don't think a powerful, performant, and scalable web application should be
difficult to set up, so we included a set of build scripts that get you started
with a simple, consistent structure that follows modern development best
practices. And when you're ready to take your app to production, Electrode
automatically deploys to your favorite cloud provider.

We also built some [awesome modules](stand_alone_modules.html) to optimize
performance and efficiency and [convenient tools](electrode_tools.html) to help
organize reusable components and optimize JavaScript bundles. These tools and
modules can be used in any React/Node.js application, even if it's not an
Electrode app.

Electrode will continue to improveâ€”future enhancements will include more
progressive web app features for mobile, bigger investments in performance, and
much more.

So let's go! Check out the developer environment
[requirements](requirements.html) and use our [Getting Started: Quick
Guide](quick_guide.html) to start building now.
