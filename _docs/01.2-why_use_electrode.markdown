At @WalmartLabs, we recently migrated our web site to a universal JavaScript
stack using React/Node.js. Along the way, we hit a few stumbling blocks:

* Code/UI reuse is hard. We reuse React components across brands, and maintaining
    thousands of flexible components is a huge headache.
* We need all application builds and deploys to be the same.
* We have a lot of teams working on a lot of projects, and need to ensure
    a consistent level of quality.
* React server-side rendering is slow and complicated to set up.

To solve these problems, we created the Electrode platform. Electrode consists
of three pillars: Electrode Core, Electrode Modules, and Electrode Tools.

*Electrode Core* provides a set of modules that get you started with a simple,
consistent structure that follows modern best practices. When you're ready to
take your app into production, Electrode automatically deploys to your favorite
cloud provider.

*Electrode Modules* improve performance, efficiency, and security by adding
features like above the fold rendering, configuration management, and cross-site
request forgery detection. These modules can be used with your existing
React/Node.js application—no need to migrate to Electrode Core.

*Electrode Tools* help organize reusable components and optimize large
JavaScript bundles. Like the modules, our tools can be used with any
React/Node.js app.

Electrode will continue to improve—future enhancements will include more
progressive web app features for mobile, bigger investments in performance, and
much more.
