> If you're writing a universal React/Node.js application, then Electrode is for you!

At [@WalmartLabs](http://www.walmartlabs.com/), we recently migrated our web site to a [Universal JavaScript](https://medium.com/@mjackson/universal-javascript-4761051b7ae9#.k3j9fruyn)
stack using React/Node.js, and along the way we hit a few stumbling blocks that
might sound familiar if you've worked on a large, complex web app before.

### Code/UI Reuse

We reuse React components across all of our brands, which means our developers
need to be able to search through thousands of components, view their
documentation and see them rendered, and use another developer's component
secure in the knowledge that its structure and implementation are consistent
with our standards. We needed a way to ensure that all components were built
according to modern best practices, without slowing our developers down with a
lot of manual configuration.

### Server Side Rendering (SSR) Performance

We serve millions of customers a day, and performance is vital to our business.
React's SSR support is vital for SEO (Search Engine Optimization) and has the potential to improve performance,
but it's intensive on the server CPUs. We needed a platform with SSR built in and
a default configuration that's optimized for performance.

### Fast Startup and Deployment

We don't have time to create an application structure, configuration files, and
Docker containers from scratch every time we start a project. We needed to start
fast and deploy fast, with consistent structure and optimal configuration every
time.

### Three Pillars

To solve these problems, we created the Electrode platform. Electrode consists
of three pillars: Electrode Core, Electrode Modules, and Electrode Tools.

***Electrode Core*** provides a set of modules that get you started with a simple,
consistent structure that follows modern best practices. When you're ready to
take your app into production, Electrode automatically deploys to your favorite
cloud provider.

***Electrode Modules*** improve performance, efficiency, and security by adding
features like [above the fold rendering](above_fold_rendering.html), [configuration management](confippet.html), and [cross-site request forgery protection](stateless_csrf_validation.html). These modules can be used with your existing React/Node.js applicationâ€”no need to migrate to Electrode Core.

***Electrode Tools*** help [organize](electrode_explorer.html) reusable components and [optimize large
JavaScript bundles](electrify.html). Like the modules, our tools can be used with any
React/Node.js app.

### Future Investment

[Electrode](https://github.com/electrode-io) will continue to improve as we continue to solve problems like these at [@WalmartLabs](http://www.walmartlabs.com/). Future enhancements will include more [progressive web app
features](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/) for web and mobile, bigger investments in performance, and much more.

We're committed to open source, which means our investment is your investment.
