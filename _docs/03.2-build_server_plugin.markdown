###Be Hapi and Build a server plugin

At WalmartLabs, we use [Hapi](http://hapijs.com/) because of it's flexible and robust plugin system. It allows us to modularize our application into isolated pieces of business logic and reusable utilities.

Let's make a deal! Actually, scratch that, let's make a plugin! Plugins are way to extend our server's functionality. Building upon our open source theme, let's make a plugin that retrieves the Github contributors of our "party friends."

We are going to use the [GitHub Api](https://developer.github.com/v3/) to grab the latest 10 contributors of our Open Source friends and display them in Your Awesome App.

The GitHub [site](https://developer.github.com/v3/) has great documentation and awesome libraries to help jumpstart our plugin. Let's begin there by installing a Node.js wrapper called [Node-github](https://github.com/mikedeboer/node-github):

```bash
  npm install github
```

At their core, plugins are a simple `register` object, that has the signature `function(server, options, next)`. Read more about building plugins from scratch in the [Hapi documentation](http://hapijs.com/tutorials/plugins). For now, navigate to the <your-awesome-app>/server/plugins folder. Make a folder called `GitHub`. Cd into your new `GitHub` folder and:

```bash
  touch github.js && index.js
```

Navigate to github.js. This is where we will make an external API call to Github and request the last ten contributors of our selected Open Source 'friend' using a URL `https://api.github.com/ + /repos/:user/:repo/contributors`. Because we are looking at public repos we do not have to go through the process of oAuth to access GitHub data. Our GitHub wrapper [library](https://github.com/mikedeboer/node-github) will allow us a built in method, `github.repos.getContributors({})` to streamline this process and return an array of Open Source contributors. We will also use [Bluebird](http://bluebirdjs.com/docs/getting-started.html), a Promise library that makes working with our async API calls much more manageable.  Copy, paste and save the code below:

```javascript
  'use strict';

  //my simple plugin requires the GitHub api
  const github = require('github');
  const Promise = require("bluebird");
  const Config = require("electrode-confippet").config;
  const newGithub = new GitHubApi(Config.githubApi);

  let guestList = [];

  const friendInfo = (githubRepo, githubUrl) => {
    return {
      avatar: githubRepo.avatar_url,
      link: githubRepo.html_url
    };
  };

  const githubInfo = {
    user: org,
    repo: friend,
    anon: true,
    page: 1,
    per_page: 10
  };

  const myGitHubFriendPlugin = (org, friend) => {

    github.repos.getContributors(githubInfo, (err, response) {

        if (err) {
          return reply("Error").code(err.code || 500);
        }

        const githubCollaborators = JSON.stringify(response.content);

        reply({githubCollaborators});
    });
  };

  myGitHubFriendPlugin.register.attributes = {
    name: 'myGitFacePlugin',
    version: '1.0.0'
  };

  module.exports = myGitHubFriendPlugin;
```

A great tool for testing your server requests (it's user interface for view response objects and errors is incredible) is [Postman]("https://www.getpostman.com/"). For now, you will have to trust as we build out Your Awesome App. Navigate to [Intermediate: Add Routes](add_routes.html), to add routing to the app and also extend our UI to display our contributor array.
