First things first. Let's make our thing... a Thing! In this Getting Started: Intermediate guide, we’ll take some of the basics we explored in our [Quick Start](quick_guide.html) and go further. We will make our resource list a dynamic list that is styled, tested, published and capable of being deployed with other deployment software like Azure, Docker and Kubernetes.

Again, we are leveraging [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/) to quick start the creation of our first stand alone component. We will globally install the Electrode [generator-electrode-component](https://github.com/electrode-io/generator-electrode-component):

```bash
$ npm install -g generator-electrode-component
```

Then [generate] (https://github.com/electrode-io/generator-electrode-component) your new component:

```bash
$ yo electrode-component
```

Fill out the Electrode generator-electrode-component with your information.

Open the application up with your favorite text editor. We will start with a fast high level view of the most important files in your component:

```
  demo
    A live demo of your component. You can play with it's integration in real time. This folder contains the .example files which you can customize to demonstrate the default state of your components when mounted in the playground.

  node_modules
    Other Javascript files contained in modules that we will use in this application, including Electrode modules that create your out-the-box Universal app.

  src
    Where all our component's source code lives, in their respective files. Non-universal apps might normally call this the “client” folder, but since our app code will run both on the client and server, via server side rendering, we call this folder "src".

  test
  Test driven development is the WalmartLabs way and critical for successful growth and scaling. All testing code lives in this folder and we will focus on unit testing with Mocha + Enzyme soon.
    |_client
      |_components
        |_helpers
      |_.eslintrc
        A configuration file that sets our custom linting rules and basic syntax validation. In this case it is extended from the electrode-archetype-react-component.

  components.json
    This JSON file is automatically generated to described and bootstrap your component so that the playground/explore can mount it in your component library.

  gulpfile.js
    Gulp is a Javascript build tool that lets us automate tasks and the gulpfile.js is where we define those tasks. We like it's simple syntax and the increased productivity from using an intuitive task runner.

```

We are going to quickly and carefully add the code below to scaffold out our Resource List and focus on the capabilities of yo generator-electrode-component. Navigate to `<your-awesome-component>/demo/examples/your-awesome-component.example`. Between your component tag, copy, paste and save the code below into this file:

```
<YourAwesomeComponent
-insert code below here-
                  />.
```

```
ourFriends={[
  'electrode',
  //un-comment the lines below to invite our friends!
  //'React',
  //'Redux',
  //'Webpack',
  //'hapi'
  ]}
```

Navigate to
`<your-awesome-component>/demo/examples` folder. Create a file titled:
`<your-awesome-component>/demo/examples/render-friend.example`. Copy, paste and save the code below into this file:

```
<RenderFriend />
```

Next, let's add a short snippet to `<your-awesome-component>/demo/examples/demo.jsx`. Copy, paste and save the code below into this file, under `title: "YourAwesomeComponent" object`:

```javascript
{
  title: "renderFriend",
  examples: [
    {
      type: "playground",
      code: require("raw!./examples/render-friend.example"),
      noRender: true
    }
  ]
}

```
Don't forget to add a comma after `TestComponent`! It should now look like this:

```javascript
  const components = [
    {
      title: "TestComponent",
      examples: [
        {
          type: "playground",
          code: require("raw!./examples/test-component.example"),
          noRender: true
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      title: "renderFriend",
      examples: [
        {
          type: "playground",
          code: require("raw!./examples/render-friend.example"),
          noRender: true
        }
      ]
    }
  ];
```

The fun part! We will be building out `your-awesome-component.jsx` and adding a two sub-components (or dumb components). Trust me, it will be worth it!

In your `<your-awesome-component>/src/components/your-awesome-component.jsx`, delete what it inside and copy, paste and save the code below into this file. Change all references from the literal `your awesome component` to your actual component name:

```javascript
  import React, { Component, PropTypes } from "react";

  import styles from "../styles/your-awesome-component.css";
  import RenderFriend from "./render-friend";

  export default class YourAwesomeComponent extends React.Component {

    renderFriends(friends) {
      const partyTime = friends.length === 5;
      return friends.map((friend, i, arr) => <RenderFriend friend={friend} partyTime={partyTime}/>);
    }

    render() {
      const { ourFriends } = this.props;

      return (
        <div>
          <div>One is not a party! Un-comment our friends in the playground above to invite them to party!</div>
          <div className="funroom">
            { this.renderFriends(ourFriends) }
          </div>
        </div>
      );
    }
  }

  YourAwesomeComponent.displayName = "YourAwesomeComponent";
  YourAwesomeComponent.PropTypes = {
    ourBestFriends: PropTypes.array
  };
  YourAwesomeComponent.defaultProps = {
    ourBestFriends: []
  };
```

Create a file titled: `<your-awesome-component>/src/components/render-friend.jsx`. Copy, paste and save the code below into this file:

{% raw  %}
```javascript
  import React from 'react';

  import PartyOn from "./party-on";

  const imageMap = {
    'React': 'http://daynin.github.io/clojurescript-presentation/img/react-logo.png',
    'Redux': 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/reactjs/redux/master/logo/logo.png',
    'Webpack': 'http://freevector.co/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/webpack.png',
    'hapi': 'http://hapijs.com/public/img/logo.svg',
    'electrode': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d0/Emoji_u26a1.svg/2000px-Emoji_u26a1.svg.png'
  }

  const RenderFriend = ({friend, partyTime}) => {

    const classes = !!partyTime ? 'friend party' : 'friend';

    return (
        <div className={classes} style={{backgroundImage: `url(${imageMap[friend]})`}} %}>
        {!!partyTime && <PartyOn />}
      </div>
    )
  };

  RenderFriend.propTypes = {
    friend: React.PropTypes.string
  };
  RenderFriend.defaultProps = {
    friend: 'electrode'
  };

  export default RenderFriend;
```
{% endraw %}


Create a file titled:
`<your-awesome-component>/src/components/party-on.jsx`. Copy, paste and save the code below into this file:

```javascript
  import React from 'react';

  const images = [
    { attire: 'kazoo', url: "https://shareicon.net/data/128x128/2016/07/27/802813_birthday_512x512.png" },
    { attire: 'hat', url: "http://icons.iconarchive.com/icons/sonya/swarm/256/Party-Hat-icon.png" }
  ];

  const PartyOn = () => (
      <div>
        {images.map((image) => <img src={image.url} alt={image.attire} className={image.attire+' party'}/>)}
      </div>
    )

  export default PartyOn;
```

In your `<your-awesome-component>/src/style/your-awesome-component.css`, delete what it inside and copy, paste and save the code below into this file:

```css
  @keyframes tada {
    from {
      transform: scale3d(1, 1, 1);
    }
    10%, 20% {
      transform: scale3d(.9, .9, .9) rotate3d(0, 0, 1, -3deg);
    }
    30%, 50%, 70%, 90% {
      transform: scale3d(1.1, 1.1, 1.1) rotate3d(0, 0, 1, 3deg);
    }
    40%, 60%, 80% {
      transform: scale3d(1.1, 1.1, 1.1) rotate3d(0, 0, 1, -3deg);
    }
    to {
      transform: scale3d(1, 1, 1);
    }
  }

  .friend {
    width: 6rem;
    height: 6rem;
    margin: 3rem;
    display: inline-block;
    border-radius: 50%;
    background-color: #efefef;
    background-repeat: no-repeat;
    background-position: center;
    background-size: 60%;
    animation-delay: .25s;
    animation-name: tada;
    animation-duration: 1s;
    animation-fill-mode: both;
  }

  .party {
    animation-iteration-count: infinite;
  }

  .hat {
    position: absolute;
    top: -67px;
    width: 105px;
    left: -48px;
    transform: rotate(-41deg);
    animation-delay: .5s;
  }

  .kazoo {
    position: absolute;
    top: -2px;
    width: 65px;
    left: 77px;
    transform: rotate(-15deg);
    animation-delay: 1s;
  }

  .blur {
    -webkit-filter: blur(5px);
    filter: blur(5px);
  }
```

Last edit! In your `<your-awesome-component>index.js`, add the line below:

```javascript
  export { default as RenderFriend } from "./components/render-friend";
```

Now run it and explore the live demo!

```bash
  $ gulp build && gulp demo
```

Walmartlabs believes that testing is critical to writing great, high performant code. This includes unit testing at both the component and application level. For your component, we are using [Mocha] (https://mochajs.org/), a Javascript testing framework that is perfect for running async tests, with [Enzyme] (http://airbnb.io/enzyme/docs/guides/mocha.html), airbnb's awesome testing utility for React.

```bash
  $ gulp check
```
One of the final steps to Creating a Standalone Component is writing the correct documentation, in the form of component.json and component.md. The Electrode team has automated this step for you, using [Electrode-Docugen] (https://github.com/electrode-io/electrode-docgen). This is a custom metadata extractor for the Electrode framework. The commands have been built into the tasks of `<your-awesome-component>/gulpfile.js`:

```
const tasks = {
  "demo": ["generate", "server-dev"],
  "demo-iso": ["dev-iso"],
  "generate": ["generate-metadata", "generate-documentation"],
  "generate-documentation": () => exec(`electrode-docgen --package ./package.json --src ./src --markdown components.md`),
  "generate-metadata": () => exec(`electrode-docgen --package ./package.json --src ./src --metadata components.json`),
  "prepublish": ["npm:prepublish"],
  "preversion": ["check-cov"]
};
```

Simply run the commands below to auto generate the necessary docs:

To generate metadata:

```bash
 gulp generate-metadata
```

To generate documentation:

```bash
 gulp generate-documentation
```

Or, to run both simultaneously, you can just run:

```bash
 gulp generate
```

Now that we've run our tests and they've passed, let's publish our component so we can use it again in Your-Awesome-App on [NPM] (https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/publishing-npm-packages). You will need to [sign up] (https://www.npmjs.com/signup) for an account if you do not have one and follow the steps in the [NPM documentation] (https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/creating-node-modules).
