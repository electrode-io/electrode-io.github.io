[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/electrode-io/electrify.svg?token=9dyHRhqfyW5wqcpfkeLr&branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/electrode-io/electrify)

An Electrode Javascript bundle viewer aptly named [Electrify](https://github.com/electrode-io/electrify), this is a stunning visual tool for analyzing the module tree of
[electrode-io + webpack](https://github.com/webpack/docs/wiki/node.js-api#stats) project bundles. It's especially handy
for catching large and/or duplicate modules which might be either bloating up
your bundle or slowing down the build process.

## Installation ##

Electrify lives on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/electrode-electrify), so if you haven't already,
make sure you have [node](http://nodejs.org/) installed on your machine first.

Installing should then be as easy as:

``` bash
sudo npm install -g electrode-electrify
```

{% include module_usage.md moduleId="electrode-electrify" %}

## Command-Line Interface ##

``` bash
electrify [stats-bundle(s)...] {options}

Options:
  -h, --help    Displays these instructions.
  -O, --open    Opens viewer in a new browser window automatically
  -m, --mode    the default file scale mode to display: should be
                either "count" or "size". Default: size
```

When you install Electrify globally, `electrify` command-line tool is made
available as the quickest means of checking out your bundle. As of `electrode-electrify@v1.0.0`,
the tool takes any [webpack-stats](https://github.com/webpack/docs/wiki/node.js-api#stats) object [example](https://github.com/webpack/analyse/blob/master/app/pages/upload/example.json) as input and spits out a
standalone HTML page as output.

You can easily chain the stats file into another command, or use the `--open`
flag to open Electrify in your browser automatically:


For example:

``` bash
electrify build/stats.json --open
```


## Palettes ##

You can switch between multiple color palettes, most of which serve to highlight
specific features of your bundle:

### Structure Highlights ###

![Structure Highlights](http://i.imgur.com/Ajp20Jxm.png)

Highlights `node_modules` directories as green and `lib` directories as orange.
This makes it easier to scan for "kitchen sink" modules or modules with lots of
dependencies.

### File Types ###

![File Types](http://i.imgur.com/oY5euGAm.png)

Highlights each file type (e.g. `.js`, `.css`, etc.) a different color. Helpful
for tracking down code generated from a transform that's bloating up your bundle
more than expected.

### Original/Pastel ###

Nothing particularly special about these palettes – colored for legibility and
aesthetics respectively.
