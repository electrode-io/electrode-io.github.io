###Server Config + Confippet

Out of the box we are given [Confippet](https://github.com/electrode-io/electrode-confippet), a versatile utility for managing your NodeJS application configuration. Its goal is customization and extensibility, but offers a preset config out of the box:

```
  config
    |_default.json
    |_development.json
    |_production.json
```

We will need to extend our default.json to include our `friends` plugin and module `./server/plugins/friends`.

Navigate to `<your-awesome-app>/config/development.json`. Copy, paste and save the code below. Make sure to add the comma `,` before `"friends"`:

```json
{
  "plugins": {
    "webapp": {
      "module": "./server/plugins/webapp",
      "options": {
        "paths": {
          "/{args*}": {
            "content": {
              "module": "./server/views/index-view"
            }
          }
        }
      }
    },
    "friends": {
      "module": "./server/plugins/friends"
    }
  }
}
```

You can learn more about Confippet and ways to extend your config in our Advanced Electrode App with the [Confippet](confippet.html) stand alone module.

You can deploy Your Awesome App to [Heroku](https://devcenter.heroku.com/categories/deployment) by following the steps in the [Getting Started: Build More](build_more.html) previous section. You can also navigate to [Intermediate: More Deployments](more_deployments.html) to learn how to deploy with [Azure](azure.html), [Docker](docker.html) and [Kubernetes](kubernetes.html).
