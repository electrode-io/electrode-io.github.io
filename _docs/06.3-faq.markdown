###You Ask, We Answer:

#### 1. Why do we focus on Universal Javascript?

*  Reusability - At [Walmart.com](www.walmart.com) we handle highly complex user interaction at an unbelievable scale. [ReactJS](https://facebook.github.io/react/) is the chosen framework to deal with us because our developers can create reusable components that we then run universally: or the client and the server.
Creating modular and reusable components has helped us to share the same code across several different pages and even different brands. The shared components all have one single source of truth and are easy to read, debug and implement, so our engineers can focus on building great features to enrich user experience.

*  Maintainability - "[Code is a liability](https://medium.com/capital-one-developers/why-everyone-is-talking-about-isomorphic-universal-javascript-and-why-it-matters-38c07c87905#.y7cy5jki3)".
Universal javascript allows developers to use modular components that are sharable, self-contained, and easy to reason about. We mentioned that we have thousands of components shared by thousand of developers at [WalmartLabs](www.walmartlabs.com). Creating strict best practices and tools like [Electrode-Explorer](electrode_explorer) help us to strengthen the increase in maintainability that Universal JS gives us.

*  SEO - Because [Walmart.com](www.walmart.com) is an eCommerce site, Search Engine Optimization is critical for our business model. To benefit from search indexing, SSR allows us to return an HTML string to search engines and our search analytics.

#### 2. Why is my server throwing error "cannot find module ..." on start up?

Most likely you are using npm@2. Upgrade to npm@3 by running command `npm i -g npm@3` and redo `npm i`.
