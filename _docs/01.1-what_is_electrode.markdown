> Electrode is a platform for building universal React/Node.js applications with standardized structure, best practices, and modern technologies baked in. Electrode focuses on performance, component reusability, and simple deployment to multiple cloud providers—so you can focus on what makes your app unique.

### Core: Quick + Easy
The heart of the platform is [Electrode Archetypes](https://github.com/electrode-io?utf8=%E2%9C%93&query=archetype%20only%3Asources%20). It allows for standardized configurations/structure of the app and its associated react components, also ensures streamlined development and deployment.

**It only takes a minute to your new Electrode application up and a few more minutes to deploy to the cloud [Getting Started: Quick Guide](quick_guide.html).**

### Stand Alone Modules: Optimize Where You Want
As part of the Electrode Platform, we have a number of modules that each do one specific task. Anything from [server-side render caching](server_side_render_cache.html) to [flexible configuration management](confippet.html). These modules can be used independently of the platform, and you can [learn more about integrating them into your existing apps](stand_alone_modules.html).

Start using these modules in your existing application with our [guide](stand_alone_modules.html).

### Tools: Power Up Your Existing Applications
The Electrode Platform also has tools that can be consumed by existing applications (though some of the tools require far less configuration to use with Electrode core and some are bundled with Electrode Core.). There are currently two powerful tools: one which enables [discovery of reusable components](electrode_explorer.html) and another to help understand the [performance of JS bundles](electrify.html).
