> Electrode is a platform for building universal React/Node.js applications with standardized structure, best practices, and modern technologies baked in. Electrode focuses on performance, component reusability, and simple deployment to multiple cloud providersâ€”so you can focus on what makes your app unique.

### Core: Quick + Easy
The heart of the platform is [Electrode Archetypes](https://github.com/electrode-io?utf8=%E2%9C%93&query=archetype%20only%3Asources%20). It allows for standardized configurations/structure of the app and its associated react components. It also ensures streamlined development and deployment.

**It only takes a minute to get your new Electrode application running and a few more minutes to deploy to the cloud [Getting Started: Quick Guide](quick_guide.html).**

### Stand Alone Modules: Optimize Where You Want
As part of the Electrode Platform, we have a number of modules that each do one specific task.This could be anything from [server-side render caching](server_side_render_cache.html) to [flexible configuration management](confippet.html). These modules can be used independently of Electrode Core, which means you can [integrate them into your existing apps](stand_alone_modules.html).

**Start using these modules in your existing application with our [guide](stand_alone_modules.html).**

### Tools: Power Up Your Existing Applications
The Electrode Platform also has tools that can be consumed by existing applications (though some of the tools require far less configuration to use with Electrode Core and some are bundled with Electrode Core). There are currently two powerful tools: one which enables [discovery of reusable components](electrode_explorer.html) and another to help understand the [performance of JS bundles](electrify.html).

**Start using these tools in your existing applications [Electrode Explorer](electrode_explorer.html) and [Electrify](electrify.html).**
