> Electrode is a platform for building universal React/Node.js applications with a standardized structure, best practices, and modern technologies baked in. Electrode focuses on performance, component reusability, and simple deployment to multiple cloud providers—so you can focus on what makes your app unique.

### Core: Quick + Easy

Electrode Core allows you to build a flexible universal react/nodejs application in minutes, with support for server-side rendering and easy deployment to multiple cloud providers. Get new projects started quickly with a simple, consistent structure that follows modern best practices.

The heart of the platform is [Electrode Archetypes](what_are_archetypes.html), which allow for standardized configurations, workflows and structure of the app and its associated react components. By enforcing a sensible structure and consistency for components, modules and the entire app, Electrode’s Archetype system helps you build scalable applications you can trust while ensuring streamlined development and deployment.

**It only takes a few minutes to get your new Electrode application running and a
few more minutes to deploy your app to the cloud. See our [Getting Started:
Quick Guide](get_started.html) to get started now.**

### Stand Alone Modules: Optimize Where You Want
As part of the Electrode Platform, we have a number of modules to help with a
variety of common tasks and features, from [server-side render
caching](server_side_render_cache.html) to [flexible configuration
management](confippet.html). These modules can be used independently of
Electrode Core, which means you can [integrate them into your existing
apps](stand_alone_modules.html).

**Start using these modules in your existing application with our [guide](stand_alone_modules.html).**

### Tools: Power Up Your Existing Applications
The Electrode Platform also has tools that can be consumed by existing
applications using other platforms (though with
Electrode core, these tools are either bundled directly or require far less configuration). There are currently
two powerful tools: one which enables [discovery of reusable
components](electrode_explorer.html) and another to help optimize your
[JavaScript bundles](electrify.html)

**Start using these tools in your existing applications [Electrode Explorer](electrode_explorer.html) and [Electrify](electrify.html).**
