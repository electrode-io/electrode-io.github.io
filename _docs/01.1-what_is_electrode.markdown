> Electrode is a platform for building universal React/Node.js applications with a standardized structure that follows best practices and has modern technologies baked in. Electrode focuses on performance, component reusability and simple deployment to multiple cloud providers—so you can focus on what makes your app unique.

### Core: Quick + Easy

Electrode Core allows you to build a flexible and universal React/Node.js application in minutes, with support for server-side rendering and easy deployment. Use Electrode to start new projects quickly with a simple, consistent structure that follows modern best practices.

The heart of the Electrode platform is managed by the [Electrode Archetype System](what_are_archetypes.html), which allows for a standardized configuration, structure and workflow throughout the entire application. By enforcing a sensible structure and consistency for components, modules and the entire app, Electrode’s Archetype system helps you build scalable applications you can trust while ensuring streamlined development and deployment.

**It only takes a few minutes to get your new Electrode application running and deployed to the cloud. See our [Getting Started:Quick Guide](get_started.html) to get started now.**

### Stand Alone Modules: Optimize Where You Want
The Electrode platform uses several modules to help with a
variety of common tasks from [server-side render
caching](server_side_render_cache.html) to [flexible configuration
management](confippet.html). These modules can be used independently of
Electrode Core, which means you can [integrate them into your existing
apps](stand_alone_modules.html).

**Start using these modules in your existing application with our [guide](stand_alone_modules.html).**

### Tools: Power Up Your Existing Applications
The Electrode Platform also has tools that can be consumed by existing
applications built with other platforms (though with
Electrode core, these tools are either bundled directly or require far less configuration). There are currently
two powerful tools: 

* one which enables [discovery of reusable components](electrode_explorer.html)

* another to help optimize your [JavaScript bundles](electrify.html)

**Start using [Electrode Explorer](electrode_explorer.html) and [Electrify](electrify.html) in your existing applications.**
