> Electrode is a platform for building universal React/Node.js applications with standardized structure, best practices, and modern technologies baked in. Electrode focuses on performance, component reusability, and simple deployment to multiple cloud providersâ€”so you can focus on what makes your app unique.

### Core: Quick + Easy
Electrode Core gets you up and running quickly by providing build scripts to streamline development and deployment, and [Electrode Archetypes](https://github.com/electrode-io?utf8=%E2%9C%93&query=archetype%20only%3Asources%20) to standardize the structure of your app and its associated React components. Electrode's archetype system provides for common patterns across projects and components, helping teams standardize on development best practices.

**It only takes a minute to get your new Electrode application running, and a
few more minutes to deploy your app to the cloud. See our [Getting Started:
Quick Guide](get_started.html) to get started now.**

### Stand Alone Modules: Optimize Where You Want
As part of the Electrode Platform, we have a number of modules to help with a
variety of common tasks and features, from [server-side render
caching](server_side_render_cache.html) to [flexible configuration
management](confippet.html). These modules can be used independently of
Electrode Core, which means you can [integrate them into your existing
apps](stand_alone_modules.html).

**Start using these modules in your existing application with our [guide](stand_alone_modules.html).**

### Tools: Power Up Your Existing Applications
The Electrode Platform also has tools that can be consumed by existing
applications (though some tools require far less configuration to use with
Electrode core, and some are bundled with Electrode Core). There are currently
two powerful tools: one which enables [discovery of reusable
components](electrode_explorer.html), and another to help optimize your
[JavaScript bundles](electrify.html)

**Start using these tools in your existing applications [Electrode Explorer](electrode_explorer.html) and [Electrify](electrify.html).**
