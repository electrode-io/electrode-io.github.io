Framework and app generator are really quite far off from what an archetype provides.
An archetype is like an npm module template, but not one that is used to generate code files and then discarded,
but more like a live "superclass" of a module; think inheritance but for npm modules.

The basic idea is that if you have dozens or hundreds of similar modules (for, say, React components),
with similar build + testing needs, you can use the same archetype for all of them. A generator like yeoman
could spit out boilerplate for you, but then what if your boilerplate changes? Your packages quickly get out of
sync with your latest best practices. Having some components on Babel 5 and some upgraded to Babel 6, for example,
was a real pain. You have to go through your dozens of packages
