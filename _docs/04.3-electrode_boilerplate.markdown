###Maximum Performance Out of the Box

In our [Getting Started](get_started.html) section, we introduced you to our Yeoman Electrode [Generator](https://github.com/electrode-io/generator-electrode) and we built an impressive application out of the built in technologies that the simple `yo electrode` command gave us:

`React * Redux * CSS Modules * Electrode-Server * Electrode Confippet * Universal JavaScript Babel * Webapack * Webpack Isomorphic Loader * React-Router * History React-Resolver * Electrode Bundle Analyzer Electrode-Static-Paths * Lodash *  Electrode-Docgen * Bluebird * Gulp * ESLint * Mocha * Enzyme * Travis * Yeoman`

This is the beginning foundation of the Electrode  [Boilerplate](https://github.com/electrode-io/electrode-boilerplate-universal-react-node). You have learned in the Stand Alone [Modules](stand_alone_modules.html) section that each of the Electrode modules are agnostic and can be used individually to enhance one specific area of your application. However, integrated together, you have a supercharged application, one that is capable of handling the complex problems we face at [WalmartLabs](www.walmartlabs.com) and reach maximum efficiency and performance.

This boilerplate includes all of the [Electrode Generator](whats_inside.html) and it also has all of the below stand alone modules and tools built in for peak optimization out-of-the-box:

*  [Above the Fold Rendering](above_fold_rendering.html)
*  [Server Side Render Cache + Profiling](server_side_render_cache.html)
*  [Stateless CSRF Validation](stateless_csrf_validation.html)
*  [Electrode Redux Router Engine](redux_router_engine.html)
*  [Electrode Bundle Analyzer](bundle_analyzer.html)
*  [Electrify](electrify.html)

>Start creating a more complex application today with the [Electrode Boilerplate](https://github.com/electrode-io/electrode-boilerplate-universal-react-node). We can't wait to see what you build!
