###Maximum Performance Out of the Box

In our [Getting Started](get_started.html) section, we introduced you to our Yeoman Electrode [Generator](https://github.com/electrode-io/electrode#yeoman-generator) and we constructed an impressive application with the built in technologies that the simple `yo electrode` command gave us (read our Getting Started: [What's Inside](whats_inside.html) to learn more):

*  [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/index.html)

*  [Redux](http://redux.js.org/docs/basics/UsageWithReact.html)

*  [React Router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router/tree/master/docs)

*  [CSS Modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules)

*  [Universal rendering](https://medium.com/@mjackson/universal-javascript-4761051b7ae9#.xjxr5yj5z)

*  [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/docs/motivation.html)

*  [Webpack Isomorphic Loader](https://github.com/jchip/isomorphic-loader)

*  [Babel](https://babeljs.io/)

*  [ESLint](http://eslint.org/)

*  [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) + [Enzyme](https://github.com/airbnb/enzyme) + [TravisCI](https://travis-ci.org/)

*  [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/)

*  [History](https://www.npmjs.com/package/history)

*  [Bluebird](http://bluebirdjs.com/docs/why-promises.html)

*  [Electrode Confippet](https://github.com/electrode-io/electrode-confippet)

*  [Electrode-Server](https://github.com/electrode-io/electrode-server)

*  [Electrode-Docgen](https://github.com/electrode-io/electrode-docgen)

This is the beginning foundation of the [Electrode Boilerplate]. You have learned in the [Stand Alone Modules](stand_alone_modules.html) section that each of the Electrode modules are agnostic and can be used individually to enhance one specific area of your application. However, integrated together, you have a supercharged application; one that is capable of handling the complex problems we face at [WalmartLabs](www.walmartlabs.com) and reach maximum efficiency and performance.

This boilerplate includes the [Electrode Generator](whats_inside.html) and it also has the following stand alone modules and tools built in for peak optimization out-of-the-box:

*  [Above the Fold Rendering](above_fold_rendering.html)
*  [Server Side Render Cache + Profiling](server_side_render_cache.html)
*  [Stateless CSRF Validation](stateless_csrf_validation.html)
*  [Electrode Redux Router Engine](redux_router_engine.html)
*  [Electrode Bundle Analyzer](bundle_analyzer.html)
*  [Electrify](electrify.html)
