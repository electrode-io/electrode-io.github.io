#### Develop tests for the above components

@WalmartLabs believes that testing is critical to writing great, high performance
code. This includes unit testing at both the component and application level.
For your component, we are using [Mocha], a Javascript testing framework that is
perfect for running async tests, with [Enzyme], Airbnb's awesome testing utility
for React, and [Chai] for assertions.

#### How to run tests

```bash
# Basic testing and linting
$ gulp check

# Continous Testing
## In one terminal
$ gulp server-test
## In a different terminal
$ gulp test-frontend-dev-watch
```
