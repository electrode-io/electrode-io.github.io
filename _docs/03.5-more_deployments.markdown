Deploying in an efficient, organized and seamless way is the key to success. A wise man once said, ["Your deploys should be as boring, straightforward, and stress-free as possible"](https://zachholman.com/posts/deploying-software). We have assembled a few more best in class software deployment options with tutorials in this section:

*  [Docker](docker.html), a new container based technology that is designed to make applications easier to [create, deploy and run](https://cloud.docker.com).

*  [Google Kubernetes](kubernetes.html), "an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of [containerized applications](http://kubernetes.io/)."
