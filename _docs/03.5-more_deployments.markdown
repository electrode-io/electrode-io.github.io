Deploying in an efficient, organized and seamless way is the key to success. A
wise man once said, ["Your deploys should be as boring, straightforward, and
stress-free as possible"]. We have assembled a few more best-in-class software
deployment options with tutorials in this section:

*  [Docker], a new container based technology that is designed to
   make applications easier to [create, deploy and run].
*  [Google Kubernetes], "an open-source system for automating
   deployment, scaling, and management of [containerized applications]."
