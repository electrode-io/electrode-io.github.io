First, let's quickly check your development environment. You will need to have the following set up to generate and deploy your awesome Electrode app in under five minutes:

## For Development On Your Local machine

1. Install the latest [NodeJS LTS binary] in your machine.  (at least v4.2 required).
  * Recommend a tool like [nvm] for managing NodeJS installations.
1. Install latest (v3) of [npm] with `npm install -g npm`.
  * Note: NodeJS v6.x already comes with npm@3 by default.
  * **Electrode requires npm version >= 3**
1. Install [Gulp] with `npm install -g gulp-cli`.
1. The text editor of your choice downloaded with CLI tools installed.

> We write NodeJS code with ES6 features that NodeJS >= 4.2 supports.

> Gulp is a Javascript build tool that lets us automate tasks.

## For Online Deployments

*  A [Heroku](https://signup.heroku.com/dc) account + [CLI tools](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-command-line).
