First, let's quickly check your development environment. You will need to have the following set up to generate and deploy your awesome Electrode app in under five minutes:

*  At least [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org) v4.2 installed in your machine.
*  The text editor of your choice downloaded with CLI tools installed.
*  Install [Gulp](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/blob/master/docs/getting-started.md) + [CLI tools](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-cli). Gulp is a Javascript build tool that lets us automate tasks.


*  A [Heroku](https://signup.heroku.com/dc) account + [CLI tools](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-command-line).
*  A [Github](https://github.com/) account.

Ready? Let's [build](build_more.html).
