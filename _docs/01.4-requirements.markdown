First, let's quickly check your development environment. You will need to have
the following set up to generate and deploy your awesome Electrode app in under
five minutes:

### For Development On Your Local machine

*   Install the latest [NodeJS LTS binary] in your machine.  (at least v4.2
    required).
    -   We recommend using a tool like [nvm] for managing NodeJS installations.
*   Install latest (v3) of [npm] with `npm install -g npm`.
    -   Note: NodeJS v6.x comes with npm@3 by default.
    -   **Electrode requires npm version >= 3**
*   [Gulp], a JavaScript task automator, which can be installed with npm: `npm
    install -g gulp-cli`.
*   The text editor of your choice, with CLI tools installed.

> We write NodeJS code with ES6 features, which are supported in NodeJS >= 4.2.

### For Online Deployments

*   A [Heroku] account and [CLI tools].
*   A [Github] account.
