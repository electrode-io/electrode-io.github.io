First, let's quickly check your development environment. You will need to have the following set up to generate and deploy your awesome Electrode app in under five minutes:

## For Development On Your Local machine

*  Install the latest [NodeJS LTS binary](https://nodejs.org) in your machine.  (at least v4.2 required).
  * Recommend a tool like [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm#install-script) for managing NodeJS installations.
*  Recommend installing version 3 of [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) with `npm install -g npm@3`.
  * Note: NodeJS v6.x already comes with npm@3 by default.
*  Install [Gulp](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/blob/master/docs/getting-started.md) with `npm install -g gulp`.
*  The text editor of your choice downloaded with CLI tools installed.

## For Online Deployments

*  A [Heroku](https://signup.heroku.com/dc) account + [CLI tools](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-command-line).
*  A [Github](https://github.com/) account.

> We write NodeJS code with ES6 features that NodeJS 4.2 supports.

> Gulp is a Javascript build tool that lets us automate tasks.
