#### Deploy with Google's Kubernetes

[Kubernetes] is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and
management of containerized applications. It was developed by Google to handle
the ops demand for an organization of that scale and the flexibility to run an
infrastructure at any size.

To start, make sure you already have a [Google Account]. Sign in to the [Google
Cloud Platform] and also sign up for a free trial on [Google Container Registry]
and create a new project. Remember your project ID and use it on your command
line:

```bash
$ export PROJECT_ID="your-project-id"
```

Install the [Google Cloud SDK]. Next, run the following command to install
[Kubernetes]:

```bash
$ gcloud components install kubectl
```

We will use your [Docker image] from the "Deploy with Docker" section. Navigate
to the docker `app` folder and update the Dockerfile to the following:

```bash
FROM node:4.5
RUN npm i -g npm@3
EXPOSE 3000
RUN mkdir -p /usr/src/app
WORKDIR /usr/src/app
COPY . /usr/src/app
RUN npm install
RUN /usr/src/app/node_modules/.bin/gulp build
CMD node server
```

Let's test out your image with Docker. Run the command below:

```bash
$ docker run -d -p 3000:3000 docker-awesome-container
```

Visit your app in the browser at `http://localhost:3000`. You can stop running
the container by using the command below:

```bash
$ docker stop docker-awesome-container
```

We can now push the image to the [Google Container Registry]. Your Docker images
will be stored in a private repo that is accessible from every Google Cloud
project as well as from outside the Google Cloud Platform.

```bash
$ gcloud docker push gcr.io/$PROJECT_ID/docker-awesome-container:v1
```

You can explore other [Kubernetes capabilities] and dig deeper in the extensive
[reference documentation].
