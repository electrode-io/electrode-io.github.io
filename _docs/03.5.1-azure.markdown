###Deploy with Microsoft Azure

[Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/app-service-web-nodejs-get-started/) is a robust collection of integrated cloud services from Microsoft. Their goal is to offer users a flexible and efficient cloud platform that you can run anywhere. Before we walk through the instructions on how to deploy Your Awesome App on Azure, please have the following ready:

A [Microsoft Azure Account] (https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/member-offers/msdn-benefits-details/)
[Azure CLI tool belt] (https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/xplat-cli-install/)

Log in to Azure from the command line:

```bash
$ azure login
```

You will be redirected to a browser to continue logging. Create the App Service app resource with a unique app name in Azure in the root directory of Your Awesome App:

```bash
$ azure sire create --git {your unique app name}
```

Follow the prompt and select an Azure region to deploy to. Open you `<your-awesome-app>/config/production.json`. Change the production port to `process.env.port`. This will allow Your Awesome App to respond to web request on the default port that iisnode listens to. It should look like the code below:

```json
{
  "plugins": {
    "inert": {
    "enable": false
  },
    "electrodeStaticPaths": {
      "enable": false
    }
  },
  "server": {
    "connections": {
      "compression": true
    },
    "debug": {
      "log": false,
      "request": false
      }
    },
  "connections": {
    "default": {
      "port": process.env.port,
    }
  }
}
```

Create a `iisnode.yml` file to the root of `<Your-Awesome-App>/iisnode.yml`. Add the code below:

```bash
loggingEnabled: true
logDirectory: iisnode
```

Next, let's deply to Azure by following the commands below:

```bash
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "Deploying to Azure"
$ git push azure master
```

Launch you live Azure app from the command line:

```bash
$ azure site browse
```
