### Build and Demo the component

Now run it and explore the live demo!

```bash
$ cd your-awesome-component
$ gulp build && gulp demo
```

Open `http://localhost:4000` in your browser to see your live demo. You will
first see a Guest List header with a checkbox listing all of our resources, now
referred to as Friends:

Have fun! Change the `invited` key to `true` in the `invitees` array. This live
demo is completely interactive:

The Electrode stack is now like an awesome party, where all of our favorite
technologies get invited:
